# Esp32-Lexical-Analyzer-compiler
This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to create a simple web server that allows users to upload a file through a web interface. Once the file is uploaded, the server performs lexical analysis on its content using a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) to identify different types of tokens such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, strings.
